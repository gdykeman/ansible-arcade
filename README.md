# Ansible-Arcade

This Github repository is for the Ansible Arcade Project.  This project is mean to serve as a hands-on demonstration of Ansible capabilities through self-led technical challenges.  Unlike conventional demos an attendee has limited oversight or instruction from a human.

There is several philosophies of this demo concept:

- Fun!  This project is meant to steal concepts from escape rooms and video games.
- Demonstration of IoT (Internet of Things) via Philips Hue smart light bulbs.
- Demonstration of other Red Hat products (e.g. Red Hat Enteprise Linux)
- Demonstration of multiple use-cases outside of Red Hat (network, Windows, etc)
- Progressive problems that go from easy to hard.
- Gamification of winning, stickers and or other swag can be rewarded for solving the puzzle.
- Re-usability to augment the Red Hat Command line Heroes arcade cabinet ideas (see https://github.com/CommandLineHeroes)
